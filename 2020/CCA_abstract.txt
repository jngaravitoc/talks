During my Ph.D., I've been focused on modeling and developing new tools to
understand the interaction of satellite galaxies with its host. In particular,
I’d build time-dependent gravitational potentials of the MW in the presence of
the Large Magellanic Cloud using Basis Field Expansions (link to video). Such a
tool will allow investigating orbits of stellar substructures in the stellar
halo
such as stellar streams, globular clusters, and satellite galaxies. Such
orbits have the potential to reveal the overall response of the DM halo and the
accretion history of the MW. These models are very useful to interpret current
and future data sets of the MW's stellar halo. One of my goals is to deliver
this year the time-dependent potentials and the software to compute orbits to
the community.

The summer school will be a great opportunity to test these tools with
interested attendants.  The scope of the summer school is very-well aligned with
the research I’d done allowing me to participate actively in the school. Among
many benefits such as strengthen my collaborations, broaden my interests, and
deepen my knowledge, I am very interested in interacting with a community that
shares similar research interests. I am also very motivated to work in a
research project in which I can apply the tools and time-dependent potentials
that I have developed. I’m looking forward to interacting, discuss and learn
with everyone and have a great summer doing science and making friends.
